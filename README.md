# Get your Tap keys
You can always use the example keys within our example app, but we do recommend you to head to our [onboarding](https://register.tap.company/sell)  page. You will need to register your `package name` to get your `Tap Key` that you will need to activate our `Card-Android`.

# Installation

We got you covered, `TapCardSDK` can be installed with all possible technologies.

## Gradle

in project module gradle 

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Then get latest dependency  in your app module gradle
```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation : 'com.github.Tap-Payments:Tap-Card-SDK-Android:{latest-tag-release}'
}
```



# Prepare input

## Documentation


### Main input documentation
To make our sdk as dynamic as possible, we accept the input in a form of a `HashMap dictionary` . We will provide you with a sample full one for reference.
It is always recommended, that you generate this `HashMap dictionary` from your server side, so in future if needed you may be able to change the format if we did an update.

## Initialization of the input

### Initialize as a  Dictionary HashMap 
You can create a Dictionary HashMap to pass the data to our sdk. The good part about this, is that you can generate the data from one of your apis. Whenever we have an update to the configurations, you can update your api. This will make sure, that you will not have to update your app on the Google Play Store.

```kotlin

# Initializing the TapCardSDK form

##  First Step :  UI
-  add TapCardKit view to your xml  as follows :
```kotlin
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".main_activity.MainActivity">

 <company.tap.tapcardformkit.open.web_wrapper.TapCardKit
        android:id="@+id/tapCardForm"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        />

</LinearLayout>
```
- or programmatically through code  as follows :
 ```kotlin
       lateinit var tapCardKitView: TapCardKit

       override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?){
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) 


        val linearLayoutParams = LinearLayout.LayoutParams(
            LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT
        )
        /** create dynamic view of TapCardKit view **/ 
        tapCardKitView  = TapCardKit(this)
        tapCardKitView.layoutParams = linearLayoutParams
        /** refrence to parent layout view **/  
        this.findViewById<LinearLayout>(R.id.linear_layout).addView(tapCardKitView)


}
        
```


## Second Step : 2 - Code
```kotlin
     TapCardConfiguration.configureWithTapCardDictionaryConfiguration(
            this /** context **/,
            findViewById<TapCardKit>(R.id.tapCardForm) /** refrence to TapCardKit view **/,
            tapCardConfig /** pass already defiend HashMap Dictionary for TapConfiguration **/,
            this /** pass this of activity that will going to listen for callbacks  **/)

```


# TapCardStatusDelegate
A protocol that allows integrators to get notified from events fired from the `TapCardSDK`. 
```kotlin

interface TapCardStatusDelegate {


    fun onSuccess(data: String)
/**
        Will be fired whenever the card sdk finishes successfully the task assigned to it. Whether `TapToken` or `AuthenticatedToken`

   /**
     *  Will be fired whenever the card element changes its height for your convience

}


```

# Tokenize the card

Once you get notified that the `TapCardView` now has a valid input from the delegate. You can start the tokenization process by calling the public interface:

```kotlin
///  Wil start the process of generating a `TapToken` with the current card data
            findViewById<TapCardKit>(R.id.tapCardForm).generateTapToken()
```
